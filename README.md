## Project Chatbot

The aim of this project is to build a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We were supposed to create a captivating chatbot that can interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision. This is the chatbot Botlynn, who will help the user to book a virtual vacation.

## The problem

It was a fun but very challenging project. I struggled with understanding the functions and when you need to explicitly say what values are moving in to the next function as an argument. I quite early decided that it seemed logical to have a switch with different activity choices to different countries. In the end I think it turned out well, but I had many difficulties in how to arrange it and write the code. I have also struggled with moving some values between functions and there are probably better ways to do it then I have done with for example selectedTravelOption. But when I finally found a way for it to work in the last bot message, I decided to leave it like this. I played around with some styling and sound effects which was fun.
I have watched the provided videos about this weeks topic, discussed and shared code with team mates, used Google, chatGPT and StackOverflow.
